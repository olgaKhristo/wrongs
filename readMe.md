to start this project i did in terminal:
npm init -y
npm install cors express
npm install nodemon -D

then added a script in package.json

npm run dev <- to run the server

then 
npm install dotenv

npm run dev again to start server

npm install pg

npm run db-setup  <-- dont remember why? to set up DB? Y have to see ("set up pomplete")

npm run dev  <-- again

if you see "listening on port 5151" then all is correct
